## 1. Title
Docusaurus uses the first heading(#) it finds to determine the name of the page. Therefore, every page should start with a header 1 denoted by a ```# ``` sign. **Always add a space after any formatting symbol!**.

```
 # Title of page
```
## 2. Authorship and Date
Just below your title, add your name and date you wrote the docs.

```
The double asterisks are used to make the text bold. *Add 3 spaces at the end of a line to introduce a line break or add an empty line between text to paragraph it.*
## 3. Add secondary headers (sections)
Secondary header make it easy for your documentation to be broken down in sections that can be browsed faster.

To add a secondary header, use ***two pound signs***:
```
## This is a section
```
## 4. Add links
If you ever find something interesting or find a really cool video that clearly explains a certain concept; please add the documentation for others to check it and save them countless hours of research.  

You can either paste directly the URL in the docs or use fancy formatting using Markdown

## 5. Use lists 

List are a very practical way of conveying information in a straightforward manner.  
**Ordered Lists**
```
1. Element
2. Element
3. Element

The following is also valid. The parser will automatically number the list for you. Don't forget spaces after the number or -

1. Element
1. Element
1. Element
```

Unordered lists
```
- Element
