# Project zero

## What is it?
Project 0 is a team of developers working on the creation of an affordable school management system that will be deployed at large. We hope that it will be used by every school in the world at one point. It will be inexpensive, and help school administrators focus more on their students than bureaucracy.

It will enable school admins and teachers to collect and analyze data about their students and know how best they can help them.
