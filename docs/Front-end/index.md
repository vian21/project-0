## NextJs vs React

- Chose NextJs

### why choose NextJs?

- NextJs is a framework built on top of React. It offers a lot of features that are not available in React, such as:
  - Server side rendering
  - Static site generation
  - Image optimization
- NextJs is also a good choice for SEO since it supports SSR and SSG.
- In prod, the client will be served from a static build using SSG not SSR due to performance reasons.
- `Authentication` (NextAuth): NextJS has also a plugin that makes authentication using different providers really easy.
- NextJs also comes in configured with TailwindCSS.
